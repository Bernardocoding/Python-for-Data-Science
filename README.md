'bibliotecanumpy.py'
In this project, I'm utilizing NumPy and Matplotlib to generate two line graphs illustrating the relationship between the diameter and weight of oranges and grapefruits sourced from a pseudo-database ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allanspadini/numpy/dados/citrus.csv').

'mean_var_std.py'
This is one of the five Data Analysis projects with Python from the freeCodeCamp bootcamp. In this project, I'm developing a function that calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and sum of a list using NumPy.
