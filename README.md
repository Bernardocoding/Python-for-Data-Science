# Python for Data Science
 
:pushpin:
'bibliotecanumpy.py'
In this project, I'm utilizing NumPy and Matplotlib to generate two line graphs illustrating the relationship between the diameter and weight of oranges and grapefruits sourced from a pseudo-database ('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allanspadini/numpy/dados/citrus.csv').

:pushpin:
'mean_var_std.py'
This is 1/5 of the Data Analysis projects with Python from the freeCodeCamp bootcamp. In this project, I'm developing a function that calculates the mean, variance, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and sum of a list using NumPy.

'demographic-data-analyzer.py'
This is 2/5 of the Data Analysis projects with Python from the freeCodeCamp bootcamp. In this project, I'm answering questions that are commented in the code from the 'adult.data.csv' database using the Pandas library from Python.
